In this certificate program from meta I will be learning react development but it will be devided into parts that are individual courses and its through these courses I will have to build some websites and increase my skills, luckily everything will be available on github and hence will be there for the public to track.

web developer roles can be categorized into
1. Front End
2. Bakc End

Front End Developer
Is involved in creation of the user experience that a user can interact with
this require a knowledge of 
-HTML
-CSS
-JS

Some CSS frameworks like
-Bootstrap
-Tailwin
-Material CSS

JavaScript Library and Frameworks such as 
-React
-Angular
-Meteor

A fron end dev might also need knowledge of UX design if they are going to work alone


BackEnd Developer 
Is developing the back end parts of the website.
some of the back end technologies are
-Databases
-BackEnd programming languages and framework
  -PHP
  -Python Django and Flask
  -NodeJS
-APIs

 -RPC
-and some basic idea on server configuration and manipulation and networking

FullStack Developer
Is the type of developer that does both backend and front end
Dev of this role are usual seniors with a number of years in the industry the deal with everything from server setup, project design,server adminstration, networking, writing of databases, implementation, developing of APIs and consuming APIs and developing front ends.

A day in life of the Front End Engineer by Benedict Hobard a software engineer at Meta

He explain that the day of the software engineer at meta is usual spent with designers and project team and some time is spent building the decided designs agreed to be built

Front end engineer work with people to build solution for people not just hiding in the office working alone. What excites most times is building something your excited about.

People collaborate with are designers, project managers and other developers.

In order to stay focused always have a purpose. When solving a really hard problem its easier to think your not making any progress and when ur nt making any progress you feel like an imposter. Technical things you need to know are how to write code, make it accessible and responsive

A software engineer job is to get the designs to live as a website. Problem solving is hard but you still need to push while going easy on yourself, adopt a growth mindset and keep going. And take time off when you can't seem to wrap your head around the road blocks

In this course we are going to build a little lemon project that will be a product that is to be built by this course but I am doing to build my own portifolio website too.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS:

Searching online comes naturally to many of us, search something is like snap of a finger write some sentence then boom you get a reply very quick. BUt how does all of this happen? Here is how based on this course: 
. Communication is enabled through the computer network that enable computers to communicate with each other. This network can be wired or wireless, a network span world wide and famously known as the internet. According to the auther the network connect to other networks through routers but according to my IT knowledge these network communicate with other networks throught routers and only use switches at industry level. Not bad but when we are using apps that have data that is remote we are communicating with servers (these are computers) that store the needed material that we are accessing through the internet and the computer that request for these material are called clients. This type of communication is called the client server model type of communication/architecture

But what is the web server?

The server is a computer that run applications that serve thr services that are accessed remotely, the server is connected tot he internet 24/7 and constantly running without stopping, servers are usual in data centers where are constantly cooled and mantained. Server represents both the hardware and the software that work together. The type of server we are interest with here is the web server that hosts the website we are working with. some of the functionality of the web server includes the web hosting, web storage, management and database management and control as well as email address managemen. It also management web request, this is a process of responding to web client requests and return what was asked about. Servers can respond to too many request per minute from different clients world wide

What are websites and web pages?

A web page is a a computer file that annotates the structure of web content such as images, videos and texts and how they are arranged on it. Collection of webpages that are linked to one another is what is called as a website but these files have to be stored in the same server directory and talk to each other probably share the same domain name and data store

when all pages have a similar web address they are called of the same website. web pages dont have to link to the same website they may link to resources on other websites. 

But how are they written?

Web pages are usual written in web editors, these editors use web technologies to write individual technologies and link them to one another

Core technologies used to build websites are 

HTML - it is used to structure the content that are used as foundaton for the web
CSS - used to arrange the content and give it a great presentation
JS - Add some functionality interactivity to the website, what to happen when a button is clicked or what should happen when something has been loaded

HTML create structure through the mark up tags (markup tags are less than keywords that are ended with greater than tag and these when combined make up the web page, this is called html description. CSS tells the browser how to show the HTML description. JS cause interaction with the user. JS is a power house of the webpage and can manipulate the content and styles.

Page rendering is a technique of displaying the website to web browser after all the content have been downloaded in order for a page to be rendered it is required to be completely downloaded together with other styles that are required

Rendered content is what the user sees.

What is the web browser?

Is an application software that is used to render web pages so users can interact with. It is what is known as client to the server, a web browser has an address bar that a user can enter the address to the website. The browser send the request to the server through the hypertext transport protocol and this request is then responded by the server to client computer and create the the web content.

This type of communication is known as a request response circle.

Web hosting,is the commercial system that allowe devs to place their websites without owning the equipments. Hosting can  be available in various forms such as 
1. Shared hosting
2. Virtual Private hosting
3. Dedicated hosting 
4. Cloud hosting

Shared hosting:
Is the cheapest type of hosting, you share with other website the resources such as RAM, CPU, and storage this might slow down your website.

It has a physical server with web server services that devide ownership of each site to its own directory and program

This option is good for website of small websites with small number of visitors, practice enviroment and it is sometime free with limitations.

Virtual Private Servers (VPS)
These have more demand than other type of websites
It is a physical device that is devided into VPS that each individual hosting an individual site

more expensive than shared hosting

Dedicate hosting
You get a dedicated physical server with all its resources that is connected to the internet, this is very expensive and is only needed when the site is having so much demand than usual.


Cloud server:

Is the type of server that has a physical space but all the resources appear as if they are from a physical machine but in real sense these servers are virtual. these are more expensive than VPS na and have low limitations
